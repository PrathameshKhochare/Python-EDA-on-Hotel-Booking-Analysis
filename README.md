- Total number of rows in data: 119390
- Total number of columns: 32
## Data Cleaning and Feature Engineering

### (1) Removing Duplicate rows
All duplicate rows were dropped.

### (2) Handling null values
- Null values in columns `company`,'children' and `agent` were replaced by 0.
- Null values in column `country` were replaced by 'others'.
        
### (3) Creating new columns
- Created new column `total_stay` by adding `stays_in_weekend_nights`+`stays_in_week_nights`.
- Created new column `total_people` by adding `adults`+`children`+`babies`.
- Created new column 'revenue' by adding 'adr'*`total_stay`.
- Created new column 'is_reserved_room_assigned'by applying Lambda function on 'reserved_room_type' and 'assigned_room_type'.

### (4) Removing outliers

- One outlier was found in the `adr` column. Simply dropped it.

### (5) Removing rows having value as zero
- Column total_people had some zero values. Simply dropped that rows.

### (6) Converting columns to appropriate data types

- Changed data type of `children`, `company`, `agent`,'total_people','revenue','adr' to int type.
- Changed data type of `reservation_status_date` to date type.
- As columns is_cancel and is_repeated_guests have boolean values, we had convert them to string values for better understanding

## Exploratory Data Analysis

Performed EDA and tried answering the following questions:

```
 Hotel wise Analysis
Q1) Which type of hotels are more preffered by guests?
Q2) What is revenue amount generated by both types of hotels? 
Q3) What is the price range over the entire year?

Q5) Which is the dominent hotel type over different year?

Cancellation overview
Q6) What is the count of Cancelled bookings?

Mainly performed using Matplotlib and Seaborn library and the following graph and plots had been used:
  -  Bar Plot.
  -  Histogram.
  - Pie Chart.
  - Line Plot.
  - Heatmap.
  - Box Plot
             
###  Univariate Analysis:

Performed univariate analysis and made following conclusions:
```
 1.) Agent no. 9 has made most no. of bookings.
 2.) Most demanded room type is A, but better adr generating rooms H, G and C. Hotels should increase the no. of room types A and H to maximise revenue.
 3.) Most popular meal type is BB(Bed and Breakfast).
 4.) Around 60% bookings are for City hotel and 40% bookings are for Resort hotel, therefore City Hotel is busier than Resort hotel.
 5.) Guests use different channels for making bookings out of which most preferred way is TA/TO.
 6.) July- August are the most busier and profitable months for both of hotels. 
 7.) Most of the guests came from european countries, with highest number of guests from Portugal.
 8.) Most common stay length is less than 7 days and generally people prefer City hotel for short stay, but for long stays, Resort Hotel is preferred.
 
```




### Bivariate Analysis :

We tried to answer following questions
```
 1.) Overall adr of City hotel is slightly higher than Resort hotel and no. of bookings of City hotel is also higher than Resort hotel. Hence, City hotel is makes more revenue.
 2.) City hotel has slightly higher median lead time. Also median lead time is significantly higher for both hotels, this means customers generally plan their hotel   visits way early.
 3.) Almost 30 % of City Hotel bookings got canceled.
 4.) Both hotels have very small percentage that customer will repeat, but Resort hotel has slightly higher repeat % than City Hotel.
 5.) TA/TO is mostly used for planning Hotel visits well ahead of time. 
 6.) While booking via TA/TO one may have to wait a little longer to confirm booking of rooms.
 7.) GDS channel brings higher revenue generating deals for City hotel, in contrast to that most bookings come via TA/TO. City Hotel can work to increase outreach on GDS channels to get more higher revenue generating deals.
 8.) TA/TO has highest booking cancellation %. Therefore, a booking via TA/TO is 30% likely to get cancelled.
 9.) Not getting same room as demanded is not the case of cancellation of rooms. A significant percentage of bookings are not cancelled even after getting different room as demanded.
 10.)Moslty bookings are done by couples(bookings have two adults.)
```

## Conclusion

```
1. City hotels are the most preferred hotel type by the guests.Around 60% bookings are for City Hotels whereas 40% are for Resort Hotels.Need to spend the most targeting fund on those hotel.
2. Revenue wise, there is no huge difference in both types as City hotel generates 18 million revenue whereas Resort hotels generates 15 million.
3. There is huge Price fluctuations in Resort hotels whereas City hotel price ranges in definite limits.The reason for this is as Resort hotel's bussiness model is seasonal based and City hotels have regular costomers.
4. City hotels had more bookings and more Cancellations. Year 2016 had maximum booking and 2015 had very less bookings.
5. Hotel industry should target months between April to Aug. Those are peak months specially for Resort hotels.
6. Almost 75-80 % guest prefer Bed and Breakfast Meal type.Full board is least prefferd Meal type.
7. Most number of booking made by agent 9 which is around 28000. and Room type A is most prefferable room type.
8. Portugal has most number (above 25,000) of guests.
9. Only 4% of guests are revisiting the same hotel.In order to increse bussiness,hotel managememt should try to attract the guests by providing better deals.Discount,coupons are the one of the ways to attract the costomers.
10. Most of the customers (91.6%) do not require car parking spaces.
11. Almost 80% guest not changed their bookings.
12. Room type G,F,H had higher adr value.Room type A is most preffered,its adr is not that much high. that means people can afford the rates of room type A.In order to increase Revenue,management should increse Room type G,H,F,A.
13. Almost 80% guests preffers Travel Agencies for thier bookings.
14. Global Distribution system generated highest revenue on the basis of ADR. City Hotel can work to increase outreach on GDS channels to get more higher revenue generating deals.
15. Optimal stay in both the type hotel is less than 7 days.
16. High rate of cancellations can be due high no deposit policies.
17. Almost 19 % people did not cancel their bookings even after not getting the same room which they reserved while booking hotel.Only 2.5 % people cancelled the booking.
18. We can say,Moslty bookings are done by couples.

## Challenges
```
(1) There was a lot of duplicate data.
(2) Data was present in wrong datatype format.
(3) Choosing appropriate visualization techniques to use was difficult.
(4) A lot of null values were there in the dataset.
